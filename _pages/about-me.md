# About James
Hi, and thanks for visiting my site! My name is James Westbrook, and I've been in various tech roles since 2016. I've done everything from system administration, IoT lighting systems, cloud engineering, and cybersecurity risk management during that time. I'm a tech enthusiast with a particular passion for AWS, Python, boto3, Terraform, and plenty of others. I look forward to writing about these topics on this site. 

When I'm not at a computer, I love spending time exploring new cities, snowboarding, backpacking, dirt biking, and doing just about anything outside.
